# 🐍 Snake Game (Console Version)

This is a simple console-based Snake game written in C++. The snake moves in a 20x20 grid, eats food to grow longer, and the game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.

## 🎮 Features

- Classic snake mechanics.
- Grid-based movement.
- Real-time input handling.
- Score tracking.
- Food spawning.
- Game over screen.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Windows OS (uses `<windows.h>` and `_kbhit()` from `<conio.h>`)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, MSVC)

> ⚠️ This game is intended to run on Windows due to its use of `system("cls")` and `Sleep()` for screen clearing and timing. It may not work correctly on other platforms without modification.
